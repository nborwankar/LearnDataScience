      "While the code is running you'll see a flashing message towards the top right corner of the notebook, in the grey menubar, which says 'Kernel Busy'.\n",
      "This means the code is being executed once through sequentially.  Expand the browser to full screen to make sure you can see the message.  When the message goes away and stays that way for 10 seconds or so, the execution is complete.  You may now dive right in.  \n",

To get rid of it for aesthetic reasons, click on the cell above it and hit shift-enter.  It should disappear.  Basically, executing the code that generated the message a second time makes the message disappear.  "
