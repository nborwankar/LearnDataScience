      "##Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we're going to use a large and messy data set from a familiar source object and then prepare it for analysis using Random Forests.\n",
      "Why do we want to use Random Forests? This will become clear very shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use a data set of mobile phone accelerometer and gyroscope readings to create a predictive model. The data set is found in R Data form [1] on Amazon S3 and raw form at the UCI Repository [2] The data set readings encode data on mobile phone orientation and motion of the wearer of the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject is known to be doing one of six activities - sitting, standing, lying down, walking, walking up, and walking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to predict, given one data point, which activity they are doing.\n",
      "We set ourself a goal of creating a model with understandable variables rather than a black box model. We have the choice of creating a black box model that just has variables and coefficients.  When given a data point we feed it to the model and out pops an answer.  This generally works but is simply too much \"magic\" to give us any help in building our intuition or giving us any opportunity to use our domain knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we are going to open the box a bit and we are going to use domain knowledge combined with the massive power of Random Forests once we have some intuition going.  We find that in the long run this is a much more satisfying approach and also, it appears, a much more powerful one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will reduce the independent variable set to 36 variables using domain knowledge alone and then use Random Forests to predict the variable \u2018activity\u2019. \n",
      "This may not be the best model from the point of view of accuracy, but we want to understand what is going on and from that perspective it turns out to be much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use accuracy measures Positive and Negative Prediction Value, Sensitivity and Specificity to rate our model."
