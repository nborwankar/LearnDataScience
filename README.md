Learn Data Science
==================

Who
---

* Nitin Borwankar http://twitter.com/nitin - primary developer


What
----

* A collection of Data Science Learning materials in the form of IPython Notebooks.
* Associated data sets.

The initial beta release consists of four major topics

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forests
* K-Means Clustering

Each of the above has at least three IPython Notebooks covering

* Overview (an exposition of the technique for the math-wary)
* Data Exploration (the nuts and bolts of real world data wrangling)
* Analysis (using the technique to get results)

One or more of these may have supplementary material.
Each of these have worksheets that contain mostly the code sections so you can iteratively explore the code.

Three openly available data sets are used.  

* For the Linear and Logistic Regression we use a data set on loans and interest rates provided by Learning Club http://learningclub.com  
* For Random Forests we use a data set of Android accelerometer and gyroscope readings used to predict body position and motion from the Human Activity Recognition project

* UN data on economic indicators of countries

Why
---

There's a need for open content to raise the level of awareness and training in basics, in the Data Science
field (circa early 2013).

IPython Notebook provides an appropriate platform for rapid iterative exploration and learning.

When
----

Starting in 2013 and intended to extend for a long while.

Where
-----

Today github, tomorrow the world.
